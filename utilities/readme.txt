A selection of utilities. 

They are presented here separetely for a few reasons, firstly, they run separately from chipFish in their own tread. Secondly, they run from the command-line.

Utils:

seqToTrk.py - converts a sequencing file (by default, GERALD output) to the chipFish Trk implementation.
