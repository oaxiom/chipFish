class Prior:
    """
    Class for representing prior model.

    Priors have two aspects: 
     * soft priors: weights for each possible edge.
     * hard priors: constraints that MUST be met.

    Soft priors are specified by an energy matrix, a weight matrix taking
    values over [0,1.0].

    Hard priors are specified as:
        * required_edges: a list of edge-tuples that must be rpesent
        * prohibited_edges: a list of edge-tuples that must not be present
        * constraints: a list of functions that take adjacency matrix as input
                       and return true if constraint met and false otherwise.
